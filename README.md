My own jellyfin container that works for me

I originally made my Jellyfin VM from the lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:latest image

It kept crashing out when playing media and then the entire service went wonky

I figured that since my own base install worked fine, then perhaps if I build my own container from scratch it would work better. 

It is working now, and live on media.theregion.beer, so we'll see how it goes ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
